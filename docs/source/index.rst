MatFeaLib
===================================

**MatFeaLib (Materials Feature Library)** is a Python library for generating elemental features from materials composition. These representations are often called “descriptors” and they can be used in machine learning and data analysis in the field of Materials Science. To get started you can check the basic tutorial.

DScribe is a Python package for transforming atomic structures into fixed-size numerical fingerprints. These fingerprints are often called “descriptors” and they can be used in various tasks, including machine learning, visualization, similarity analysis, etc. To get started you can check the basic tutorial.

matminer is an open-source Python library for performing data mining and analysis in the field of Materials Science. It is meant to make accessible the application of state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning algorithms to materials science data with just a few lines of code. It is currently in development, however it is a working code

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.
